      <description>Background This is the first post of R with White Dwarf and I decided to start this blog with a basic tutorial. There is already a lot of information in the web about getting started with R. With a simple google search you can easily find info on how to install it, how to use R studio or other text editor, learn about the basic functions and concepts, etc. Therefore, I decided to start with a topic that is also basic but slightly less common: Functions.</description>
