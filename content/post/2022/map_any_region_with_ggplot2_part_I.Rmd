## Scope of this post

Have you ever had issues when making maps because you don't have the exact coordinates of the region or country that you need? Do you need to do maps with pure R without the use of third party elements such as google maps? - If so, I have the right tutorial for you.

Today there are a lot of ways for making maps in R. Explain the strategy.

This is the first of 3 posts to learn **how to map any region in the world with R** using this technique. Here is the list of topics:
	1) Web scrapping with nominatim open street maps.
	2) Maps of cities with ggplot2 and maps packages.
	3) Making a single script for fast replication.
